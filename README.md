# Neural Implicit Representation for Images

This repository includes Jupyter Notebooks for implementing neural implicit representation for the sample images in the folder `Sample Images`. Methods used for image representation reconstruction include:
1. Direct image regression with implicit neural representation in `#1: Image regression with implicit neural representation.ipynb`
2. Image regression with Fourier features in `#2: Image Regression with Fourier Features.ipynb`
3. Image reconstruction from its radon transform in `#3: Image Reconstruction from Radon transform.ipynb`
